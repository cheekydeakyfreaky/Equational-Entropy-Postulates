# Equational Entropy: An Informational Framework for Evaluating Theoretical Structure in Physics

This repository contains a preliminary draft and related materials for the concept of **Equational Entropy (EE)** — a proposed framework to quantify the informational complexity of physical equations and theories.

---

## Overview

Equational Entropy (`E`) is defined as the sum of:

- **Conceptual Novelty (`N`)** — How much new physics an equation introduces (e.g., new principles, constants)
- **Structural Complexity (`C`)** — The symbolic and mathematical complexity of the equation, reduced by its symmetries

**Key Equation:**

E = N + C

This framework aims to:
- Quantify elegance and efficiency in theoretical physics
- Provide a tool for evaluating unifications
- Offer a heuristic for evaluating new or AI-generated theories

## Status

This work is **in progress** and currently under consideration for submission to the *History and Philosophy of Physics* category on arXiv.  
I am actively seeking endorsement for submission.
