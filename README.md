Equational Entropy: An Informational Framework for Evaluating Theoretical Structure in Physics

This repository contains a preliminary draft and related materials for the concept of Equational Entropy (EE) — a proposed framework to quantify the informational complexity of physical equations and theories.

Overview

Equational Entropy ($\mathcal{E}$) is defined as the sum of:

Conceptual Novelty ($\mathcal{N}$): How much new physics an equation introduces (new principles, constants)

Structural Complexity ($\mathcal{C}$): The symbolic and mathematical complexity of the equation, reduced by its symmetries


This framework aims to:

Quantify elegance and efficiency in theoretical physics

Provide a tool for evaluating unifications

Offer a heuristic for evaluating new or AI-generated theories


Key Equation

Status

This work is in progress and currently submitted as a draft to the History and Philosophy of Physics category on arXiv.

I am currently seeking endorsement for submission.
